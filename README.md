# Rise of Music
Rise of Music is an application which plays the background music for Rise of Nations (RoN), instead of using the current buggy audio system in game.  It does so with the use of an executable you run before a round of Rise of Nations and a Big Huge Script (BHS) that is running while you are playing the game.
